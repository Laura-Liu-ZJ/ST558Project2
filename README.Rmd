# Automating Process
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,results='hide'}
# prepare for the library
library(rmarkdown)
library(tidyverse)
# get weekdays variables
weekdays <- c("monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday", "sunday")
# create a list for each weekday with just the weekday parameter
params <- lapply(weekdays, FUN = function(x){list(weekday = x)})
# create file name
reports <- tibble(paste0(weekdays, ".md"), params)
# automatically output 7 files
apply(reports, MARGIN = 1, FUN = function(x){
  render(input = "project2.Rmd", output_file = x[[1]], params = x[[2]])
})
```
